  <h1 id="why_kentucky">Why Kentucky</h1>
    <p>Kentucky has positioned itself to become the next epicenter of film making in the United States. In 2022, Kentucky passed an incentive program offering tax credits on film production in Kentucky the range of 30-35%. This financial incentive has sparked a renewed interest in Kentucky and sparked ancillary industries, such as the the production soundstage in louisville slated to open in 2026, to organically appear. Financial incentives and production capability aside, Kentucky offers a truly diverse selection of film shoot locations. The beauty and mystery of the mountains in the east, the rolling hills and farmland in the west, the bluegrass-covered Savanahs in the central region and more navigable waterways than any state in the continental US. In addition, Louisville offers a metropolitan location that sits on the banks of the mighty Ohio river. Financial incentive and bountiful locations, Kentucky is the perfect location for your next film.</p>
