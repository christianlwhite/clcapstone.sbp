CODE LOUISVILLE WEB DEV CAPSTONE PROJECT
SUBMITTED BY: CHRISTIAN WHITE
PROJECT NAME: clcapstone.sbp

Special Requirements

In order to run correctly, please install the following:

Express.js
Nodemon

After these packages are installed, you must run "npm start" in the code terminal and the project will display in your browser at "localhost:3000".

Please Note:
I am aware that the API key is visible in the code and that this is not best practice. I was unable to address this in the time we had to complete the project but will research this further before running the website live.  

About the Project:
Small Batch Productions is an emerging small film production company located in Louisville, KY.  The company goal with the website is to promote their upcoming film projects and raise awareness of the Kentucky film industry as a whole.  The compmany also wanted to make sure anyone interested in future projects could contact them easily.

The website layout is limited to one page with links to the main headings to keep the page functionality as quick as possible and to provide a nice user experience.  There are 6 main headings that connect to sections within the page, HOME, ABOUT US, PROJECTS, WHY KENTUCKY, CONTACT US and PROJECT AND INVESTOR RELATIONS.  Each section provides important information regarding the company's previously stated goals with the website development.

Project Features:
For this project, I have included the following features from the Web Development Capstone Project Guidelines requirement list:

Overall expectations concerning visual appeal were addressed through color and font choices.  Responsive Design was addressed through use of CSS, Flexboxes, Javascript functions and screen adaptability.

From the Features list section 1 (asked to choose at least two):

1.  Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.  A copyright and date object were used in the footer to protect the site and to show that it is currently maintained.

2.  Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved).  In the PROJECTS section an email submission was set up to be required for the input field and subscribe function.

3.  Visualize data in a user friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc).  A navigational list was used to ensure the page sections are accessible from the heading of the page and to ensure that returning to the top is easy.  A table was also used in the WHY KENTUCKY section to highlight the photographs of the scenic areas offered in KY, offer a brief description and to allow a current temp to be viewed.

From the Features list section 2 (asked to choose at least one):

1.  Retrieve data from a third party API and use it to display something within your app.  In the WHY KENTUCKY section a weather API from openweathermap.org is being utilized to offer current temps.  In the CONTACT US section a Google Map API is being offered to map directions to the office location.

From the Features list section 3 (optional/offered as a swap for section 1 choices):

1.  Implement modern interactive UI features (e.g. table/data sorting, auto complete, drag-and-drop, calendar-date-picker, etc.).  In the PROJECTS section an "add to calendar" button is offered to be able to add movie release dates to the users calendar from the website.
